Introduction

I've been in the industry for 18 years and participated in many different roles on a software development team. Those include, dev, lead dev, architect, cm, qa, system admin/engineer and project manager. This is my attempt to begin documenting resolutions to problems that I have faced in the past and new ones I face in the future. It's is my attempt at giving back to the community.
